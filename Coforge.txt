=>Intern():- The method intern() creates an exact copy of a String object in the heap memory and stores it in the String constant pool.

=>volatile:- keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable's value can be modified by different threads

=>String utility:-  A utility class in Java is a class that provides static methods that are accessible for use across an application.

=>How to Create a Java Utility Class:- we use a public access modifier and also declare the class as final. The final keyword used when 
                                       creating utility classes means that the class would remain unchangeable. It cannot be inherited.
=>StringUtils Class Available utility Methods:-
1.isBlank(String str): This method checks if a String is null, empty, or contains only whitespace characters. 
                       It returns true if the String is blank, and false otherwise.
2.remove(String str, char remove): This method removes all occurrences of a specified character from a String and returns the modified String.
3.isNumeric(String str): This method checks if a String contains only numeric characters (0-9) 
                         and optionally a minus sign at the beginning. It returns true if the String is numeric, and false otherwise.

+++++Diffrent b/w Collection and Collections ++++++++
 =>Collection is a base interface for most collection classes, whereas Collections is a utility class

=============================Serialization and Deserialization===================================================
=>Serialization:- Serialization is a mechanism of writing the state of an object into a byte-stream.
         Method:- writeObject() method of ObjectOutputStream class.
=>reverse operation of serialization is called deserialization where byte-stream is converted into an object.
         Method:- readObject() method of ObjectInputStream class.

========================================Main Mothod -Override, Overloaded -> YES Ya NO===================================================
Yes, we can overload the main() method in Java.Java class can have any number of overloaded main() methods. 
  But the very first thing JVM (Java Virtual Machine) seeks is the original main() method.
No, we cannot override main method of java because a static method cannot be overridden.

==================================Singly linked===================================================================== 
=>Singly linked:- singly linked list is a set of nodes where each node has two fields ‘data’ and ‘Address’. The ‘data’ 
field stores actual piece of information and ‘Address’ field is used to point to next node. Basically the
‘Address’ field stores the address of the next node.

======================================Why is Java platform independent================================================= 
=>Because we can write java code in one system run on another system. Java does not compile into machine code,
  it compiles into byte code and it will run or interpreted using JVM( java virtual machine). Which makes java platform independent.
